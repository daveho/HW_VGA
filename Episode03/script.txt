The purpose of the readout module is to generate the addresses of character
and attribute bytes so that the pixel generator can use them to generate
pixels and colors to send to the output module.

In order to understand the design of the readout module, let's first discuss
the organization of video memory.

The display controller uses the VGA 640 by 480 mode to generate a text display
using a font with 8 by 16 characters. Dividing 640 by 8 and dividing 480 by 16
yields a text display with 80 columns and 30 rows of characters. Each displayed
character is represented by two bytes, one for the character and one for
the attribute byte containing the foreground and background colors. That means
that each row of characters requires 160 bytes of data. The total number of
bytes of memory needed for the display is 80 times 30 times 2, which is 4800.
This is why the VRAM module uses two 4KB dual port RAM chips rather than just 1:
with only one 4KB RAM chip, there would not be enough room for all of the
character and attribute information.

Each row of chararacters is displayed as 16 rows of pixels. The pixels are
rendered on the fly by fetching the appropriate bytes of character and attribute
information at the exact times they are needed by the pixel generator. This
means that the addresses of the bytes fetched for each of the 16 rows of pixels
in a character row are exactly the same each time. The only thing that
distinguishes the pixel rows in one character row from each other is the
low 4 bits of the vertical count, which selects the correct row of pixels
from the representation of the character glyph in the font ROM.
