Redesign of HCntCtrl so that the sync pulse and back porch
come *before* the visible part of the line. The motivation
is to have VCOUNT accurately reflect the true pixel row
when the the contents of a visible line are being generated.
(The issue with the original approach is that if we initiate
fetching data from video memory before the visible part of
the scanline is generated, VCOUNT reflects the "previous" line.
The revised approach means that the hsync pulse and back porch
are now considered part of the "next" line, meaning that the
VCOUNT value is the same as the visible region of the scanline
that immediately follows them.)

Original timing vs. revised timing (HCOUNT values when timing pulses are
generated):

Event          Orig       Revised    Description

BeginPulse     655         799       Beginning of hsync pulse
EndPulse       751          95       End of hsync pulse
HVisEnd        639         783       End of visible part of scanline
HSCAN_END      799         143       End of scanline (and begin next
                                       visible region)

Basically, all times are moved later by 144 clocks.

Note that the -HCOUNT_CLR signal (resetting the HCOUNT counters)
will need to be generated on PulseBegin rather than HCOUNT_END.
